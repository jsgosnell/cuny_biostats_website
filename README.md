This site is a work in progress! Original website is being migrated to github to 
accompany the [new course notes/book](https://jsgosnell.github.io/cuny_biostats_book/).

Developed with support from Baruch College's Center for Teaching and Learning

# Course and OER History

I proposed the Biostatistics (ENV/BIO 2100) course in 2017 and taught for the 
first time in 2018. The course focuses on teaching introductory statistics from 
a biological perspective, so examples, papers, and problems focus on natural 
systems when possible.

My desire to teach the course using the R statistical language and using freely 
available resources coincided with a statewide funding effort at CUNY and SUNY 
campuses to develop OER (open-educational resources).  Baruch College's Center for
Teaching and Learning have supported the continued development of the class.

The class now includes 

* website housing slides and 
associated material
* tutorials for many lessons using Swirl (https://swirlstats.com/)
    * developed with support of a QUBES working group (https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/teaching_r_fmn)
* this book!
