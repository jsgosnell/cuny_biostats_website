## Objective

To introduce students to how data can be used to estimate parameters of
interest and associated sampling error. Basic probability is also
reviewed, and students are introduced to the ggplot2 package in R. By
the end of the lesson, you should be able to

-   explain how sampling error is estimated (conceptually and via
    formulas) for various distributiond

-   develop and interpret 95% confidence intervals

-   Explain probability concepts including independence and
    conditionality and explain connections to the addition rule,
    multiplication rule

-   Explain the terms sensitivity and specificity

-   develop plots using ggplot2
