Using these skills and applying concepts correctly to interpret data
sets may seem easy when you read about them or listen during class, but
practice is key to ensuring you understand the material. Practice
problems are provided for each lesson. The link above points you to the
appropriate link in the [course
notes](https://jsgosnell.github.io/cuny_biostats_book/){target="_blank"}.
You can make a copy (technically a *fork*, since you can't directly edit
it) of the entire course notes website in github \@
[https://github.com/jsgosnell/cuny_biostats_book](https://github.com/jsgosnell/cuny_biostats_book){target="_blank"}
and work from there. The benefit is this allows you to see updates to
the site (if you sync your fork). The downside is you have to work
interactively or build the entire site when you render a changed file.
This is doable but may take more time than students need (and may lead
to merge issues!).

Alternatively,your instructor may use a different delivery method (like
github classroom) or provide alternative problems.

**In general you should only work edit .qmd files! Everything/anything
else is produced during the session and should not be edited. All files
can be uploaded to github though.**

Solutions are also provided for all problems via the [course
notes](https://jsgosnell.github.io/cuny_biostats_book/){target="_blank"},
but try them before you look at the answers!
