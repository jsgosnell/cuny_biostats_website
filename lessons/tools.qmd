<!-- COMMENT NOT SHOW IN ANY OUTPUT: Code chunk below sets overall defaults for .qmd file; these inlcude showing output by default and looking for files relative to .Rpoj file, not .qmd file, which makes putting filesin different folders easier  -->

## Objective

To introduce students to the tools we will be using in class and explain
why we are using them. By the end of the lesson, you should be able to

-   explain what R, Rstudio, git, and markdown are

-   open an R script, .Rmd, and .qmd file

-   define terms including function, library, and class

-   carry out basic operations in R , including

    -   opening a file in R

    -   producing summary statistics

    -   plotting data

    -   developing a linear model

    -   working with markdown via .rmd or .qmd files

    -   *Note: The idea is just to let you see its possible! We will
        repeat much of this later in class for understanding*

-   define and use version control
